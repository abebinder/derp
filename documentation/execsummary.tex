\chapter*{Executive Summary}
OSNAP project management requires frequent visibility into developer activity to reduce software development risks. Agile practices, such a daily standups, are costly and inappropriate for the size, geographic distribution, and number of development teams. The OSNAP Development Experience Reporting Platform (DERP) saves thousands of hours of development and project management time by addressing these challenges. DERP also adds new capabilities for continuous development process improvement.

DERP allows developers to connect at anytime from any Internet connected location to support the needs of project and program management. Daily status reports via DERP can be submitted at the developer's convenience and replace the daily standup meeting. Weekly reports are automatically routed to the appropriate project manager for use in executive progress reporting. The reporting records kept by DERP will provide a history for use in project postmortem activities and provide a basis for process improvement. In future revisions, DERP may be integrated with an automated testing framework to allow developers to get early feedback on the integration state of their software deliverables.
